#### Challenges and Solution

### 1. Handling Date Input
**Challenge**: Ensuring the API accepts and processes dates in a consistent format while avoiding errors due to invalid formats.

**Solution**: Implemented ISO 8601 date format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`) parsing using Python's `datetime.fromisoformat` method. Added error handling to return user-friendly messages for invalid formats.

### 2. Analytics Performance
**Challenge**: Calculating total expenses and category breakdowns efficiently for large datasets.

**Solution**: Used SQLAlchemy's `func.sum` and `group_by` methods to perform database-side aggregations, reducing the load on the application logic.

### 3. Verifying Database Accuracy
**Challenge**: Ensuring that API responses matched the underlying data in the SQLite database for analytics endpoints.

**Solution**: Used SQLite CLI and DB Browser for SQLite to run queries and cross-verify API outputs against the actual database content.

### 4. Input Validation
**Challenge**: Ensuring that required fields like `amount` and `date` were always provided while allowing optional fields like `description`.

**Solution**: Added robust input validation in the routes to check for missing fields and return descriptive error messages when validation failed.
