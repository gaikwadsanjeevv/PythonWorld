# The general guideline in programming is to minimize the use of global variables and favor functions and local variables wherever possible
# It reduces the side effects - since global variable can be modified from anywhere in the code can lead to unexpected and difficult to debug side effects
#Improved  Encapsulation: by defining more local variables we can make sure to garranttee the applicaton for better encapsulation.
# Enhance Readibility and maintaibility
#Better Testability
